# LightningVM

Work in progress!

LightningVM is a virtual machine that still has no specific purpose.
There are a few branches, two of them have a GUI and the last one does not.
Master branch is non-gui for the moment and will be merged with the other branch I choose that is more stable (non-gui mode possibly).
